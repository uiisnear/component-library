## Credits

All credits to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for creating very clean and easy to extend components to streamline application creation in a fast and easy to use way. That's why we decided to bring the best to Near.

Also [Tailwind](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs) has allowed us to create component styling very easily.

Thanks to the combination of these two great tools, many new Web2 developers will be able to create their own applications on top of BOS.
